# Week 5 Task 4

In this Task we will add features to the previous Task.

TASKS: Building upon the harmonic.py program in the previous task
1. Calculate the kinetic energy, elastic potential energy, and total energy of the particle evolving through real time. 

2. Plot the three energies against time. For time steps that are too large (e.g. dt=0.01), the total energy is ill-behaved. Try decreasing dt until the total energy is constant within 0.01 Joules throughout the simulation.
